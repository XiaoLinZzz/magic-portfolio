After getting tired of binary tree problems, I switched to backtracking algorithms while also studying some linked list problems.

Here are the problems I worked on today:

1. [Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.cn/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/description/)
2. [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.cn/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/)
3. [Combinations](https://leetcode.cn/problems/combinations/description/)
4. [Jump Game](https://leetcode.cn/problems/jump-game/description/)
5. [Permutations](https://leetcode.cn/problems/permutations/submissions/579847360/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-100-liked)
6. [Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.cn/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-100-liked)
